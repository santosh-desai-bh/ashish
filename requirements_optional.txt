# Optional dependencies for enhanced First Mile clustering
# The system works without these, but they provide more accurate distance calculations

# For precise geographic distance calculations
geopy>=2.0.0

# For advanced clustering algorithms (currently not used but ready for future enhancements)
scikit-learn>=1.0.0

# Installation:
# pip install geopy scikit-learn

# Note: If these are not installed, the system will automatically use
# built-in fallback implementations with the Haversine formula
